// All times below are UTC (graphile-worker doesn't take a timezone). Display
// time in the UI is always JST (Asia/Tokyo) — see lib/format.ts.

// Note: graphile-worker's crontab parser only allows [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9:_-]*
// for task identifiers, so we use colons instead of dots.

# Observation ingest. Hourly cadence keeps storage charts fresh without
# hammering upstream — the kasenbosai adapter only fetches dams that have an
# external_ids->>'kasenbosai' set, so empty matches are cheap. Once
# beta-stage name-matching populates those IDs, this cron starts producing
# real observations on its own.

# Suimon backfill remains opt-in only. Enqueue ad-hoc jobs via add_job
# rather than running it on a fixed cron, so we don't keep hammering the
# upstream when there's nothing new to import.

# upstream APIs all at once.
